  return `## Tool Call Format (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use the native tool calling mechanism. NEVER output tool calls as text.**

When you need to call a tool:
1. Use the tool call interface provided by the system
2. Do NOT write tool calls as plain text like \`assistant to=functions.XXX\`
3. Do NOT output JSON directly in your text response
4. The system handles tool call formatting automatically

**CORRECT**: Invoke the tool through the tool call interface
**WRONG**: Writing \`assistant to=functions.todowrite\` or \`json\n{...}\` as text

Your tool calls are processed automatically. Just invoke the tool - do not format the call yourself.`
}

export function buildAntiDuplicationSection(): string {
  return `<Anti_Duplication>
## Anti-Duplication Rule (CRITICAL)

Once you delegate exploration to explore/librarian agents, **DO NOT perform the same search yourself**.

### What this means:

**FORBIDDEN:**
- After firing explore/librarian, manually grep/search for the same information
- Re-doing the research the agents were just tasked with
- "Just quickly checking" the same files the background agents are checking

**ALLOWED:**
- Continue with **non-overlapping work** - work that doesn't depend on the delegated research
- Work on unrelated parts of the codebase
- Preparation work (e.g., setting up files, configs) that can proceed independently

### Wait for Results Properly:

When you need the delegated results but they're not ready:

1. **End your response** - do NOT continue with work that depends on those results
2. **Wait for the completion notification** - the system will trigger your next turn
3. **Then** resume once the system notification says the results are available
4. **Do NOT** impatiently re-search the same topics while waiting

### Why This Matters:

- **Wasted tokens**: Duplicate exploration wastes your context budget
- **Confusion**: You might contradict the agent's findings
- **Efficiency**: The whole point of delegation is parallel throughput

### Example:

\`\`\`typescript
// WRONG: After delegating, re-doing the search
task(subagent_type="explore", run_in_background=true, ...)
// Then immediately grep for the same thing yourself - FORBIDDEN

// CORRECT: Continue non-overlapping work
task(subagent_type="explore", run_in_background=true, ...)
// Work on a different, unrelated file while they search
// End your response and wait for the notification
\`\`\`
</Anti_Duplication>`
}
